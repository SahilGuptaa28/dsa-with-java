DSA with Java (Short Revision Code)

This repository contains my short + optimized Java solutions for important Data Structures & Algorithms problems.

I am keeping the code concise mainly for revision and fast recall — not full long editorial style.
This helps me revise concepts before interviews easily and keep track of patterns.

Arrays

Strings

(more topics will be added gradually like Binary Search, Sliding Window, DP, Trees, etc.)

Repo Purpose
