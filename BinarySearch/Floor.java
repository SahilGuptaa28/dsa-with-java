/*Given a sorted array arr[] and an integer x, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is less than or equal to x. This element is called the floor of x. If such an element does not exist, return -1.

Note: In case of multiple occurrences of ceil of x, return the index of the last occurrence. */
